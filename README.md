# Codenames
_(Blacker Hovse Day After 2024 project)_

Codenames, but the cards are spread out on the Caltech campus. Spymasters give clues asynchronously through a web application, and operatives try to find their agents faster than the opposing team. To "tap" on card they have to find a code and input it to the website.

All board state is replicated real-time to all players using WebSockets, and the UI is also mobile-optimized.
